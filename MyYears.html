		<h2>My 6th grade year</h2>
		<p>During my 6th grade year I wasn’t shy or scared for middle school. As the time came for middle school i felt ready and when the day came I loved it. Throughout the school year I stopped talking to the kids I came with and branched off in my own group. Honestly throughout the year I had breeze and everything went so fast that couldn’t believe it was over. My 6th grade year was not how i thought it would be but, instead easy and fun. I had a fun 6th grade experience and gained more confidence when i made the track team. This was one of my best accomplishments because i was put on the A team rely and we one first place. I will forever remember my 6th grade experience.</p>

		<h2>My 7th grade year</h2>
            <p>7th grade was a learning experience for me. I came to 6th grade with so many friends but soon found out that sometimes you lose friends and gain some.
During 7th grade i became the captain of the track team and became more involved with the school. I got a lot of more friends and had teachers that I look up to and have helped me deal with some  of my life experiences. In 7th grade I really locked down on my grades for the hope of getting into a good high school.While in 7th grade I started to learn that you can have other friends and you grow and change as you grow up and so do your friends</p>

		<h2>My 8th grade year</h2>   
        <p>So far 8th grade still doesn't seem like grade. I have reconnected with many of my old childhood friends for the fear of losing them and not being able to see them again.At first I was scared of the thought of going to a new school and losing contact with some of the girls I call family. Now i feel that if these people are really my family we will keep in contact and be forever family. I have been going to different high school trying to decide where i wanna go. I have my heart set on Satin Anthony, but my other choices are Polly and Millikan. This year i’m really involved and i am planing our eighth grade events and graduation.</p>
